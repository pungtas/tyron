Self-sovereign digital identity software development kit for tyron decentralized identity applications on the Zilliqa blockchain platform.

For the CRUD operations of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), tyronZIL implements the Tyron SSI Protocol, which includes the deployment of the user-owned [didc.tyron smart contract (DIDC)](./src/lib/blockchain/smart-contracts/DIDC-latest.scilla). With tyron, the user is in control of their decentralized identity and the caller to every transition for the DIDC to execute tyronZIL transactions.

## W3C DID-Method

The tyron.did dApp implements the [tyronZIL DID-Method](https://www.tyronzil.com), which is conformant with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) specification and the first Zilliqa's DID-Method registered in the [W3C DID Specification Registries](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/).

## Problem summary

Identities on the internet remain centralized, mainly by identity providers such as Facebook, Google and PayPal. Thus, when people shop online and login with these accounts, they don't have enough control nor understanding of how their data is used and shared with third parties. Furthermore, blockchain applications are still difficult to grasp for most regular users, and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can make the user experience much better while increasing privacy and security.

## Tyron

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) allows people to manage their digital identities, proving who they are without a middleman, by anchoring DIDs on blockchain platforms as a shared root of trust. However, most blockchains still can't provide decentralized identity at scale. By implementing the Tyron SSI Protocol, we aim to solve this issue and enable user-controlled digital identities.

The word Tyron derives from the Greek *turannos* that means sovereign, and ***Tyron's purpose is to give people sovereignty over their data***.
